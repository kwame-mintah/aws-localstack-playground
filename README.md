# üõù AWS Localstack Playground

 As the name of the repository suggests, it's just a [*playground*](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/playground). Will be using it to play with different AWS services supported by the localstack, to gain a better understanding.

 ## Prerequisites

1. Docker for deskstop.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository locally,
2. Run the following command `docker-compose up -d`

There is nothing else to it, fairly straight forward.
